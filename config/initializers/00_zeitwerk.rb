    Sorry for the hassle, but to fix https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues/1246
    you need to copy this line of code to your config/initializers/production.rb:

    Dir[Rails.root.join("extras", "*.rb").to_s].each {|f| require f }

    It goes inside the `if Rails.env.production`, see production.rb.sample.

    Perhaps all of config/initalizers/production.rb should be moved into
    config/environments/production.rb but that's more weird boot issues than I can
    take on today.
